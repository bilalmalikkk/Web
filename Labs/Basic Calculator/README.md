# Basic Calculator

This is a basic calculator implemented in HTML and JavaScript. It provides simple arithmetic calculations and some additional mathematical functions.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Support for calculating the result using the "=" button.
- Clear Entry (CE): Clears the current entry without affecting the entire calculation.
- Clear (C): Clears the entire calculation.
- Factorial (!): Calculates the factorial of a given number.
- Power (^2): Calculates the square of a given number.
- Log2: Calculates the base 2 logarithm of a given number.
- Log10: Calculates the base 10 logarithm of a given number.
- π (PI): Inserts the value of π (approximately 3.1416).
- Square Root (√): Calculates the square root of a given number.
- Sine (sin): Calculates the sine of a given number.
- Cosine (cos): Calculates the cosine of a given number.
- Tangent (tan): Calculates the tangent of a given number.
- Percentage (%): Converts the current number to a percentage value.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. You'll see the calculator interface with buttons representing numbers, operations, and additional functions.
3. Click on the number buttons to input numbers.
4. Use the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform basic arithmetic calculations.
5. Press the "=" button to calculate the result of the entered expression.
6. The "CE" button clears the current entry, while the "C" button clears the entire calculation.
7. The factorial (!) button calculates the factorial of the entered number.
8. The power (^2) button calculates the square of the entered number.
9. The logarithm buttons (Log2 and Log10) calculate the corresponding logarithms of the entered number.
10. The "π" button inserts the value of π (3.1416) into the calculation.
11. The square root (√) button calculates the square root of the entered number.
12. The trigonometric buttons (sin, cos, tan) calculate the corresponding trigonometric functions of the entered number.
13. The percentage (%) button converts the current number to a percentage value.

## Example

1. Enter a number using the number buttons.
2. Click an operation button (+, -, *, /) to choose an arithmetic operation.
3. Enter another number using the number buttons.
4. Press the "=" button to calculate the result.
5. Use additional functions (factorial, power, logarithms, etc.) as needed.

## Notes

- This calculator uses the `eval` function for arithmetic calculations, which might not be the most secure approach for real-world applications.
- Make sure to input valid numerical expressions to avoid unexpected results.
- Keep in mind that some functions (e.g., factorial, power) might have limitations based on the range of valid input values.
